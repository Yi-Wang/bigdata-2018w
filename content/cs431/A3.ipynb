    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some graph analysis, using a graph of the Gnutella server network.   In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
    "For example, this line:\n",
    "> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the adjacency list for server `91`.   It indicates that there are edges from server `91` to servers `243`, `1923`, and `2194`.    According to the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which collected these data, [the graph includes 6301 servers and 20777 edges](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html).\n",

    "#### Question 1  (6/24 marks):\n",
    "\n",
    "To get warmed up, you should first write Spark code to confirm or determine some basic properties of the Gnutella graph.  Write code that will display answers to the following questions:\n",
    "- How many nodes and edges are there in the graph?  (This should confirm the numbers given above.)\n",
    "- How many edges of each outdegree are there?   That is, how many nodes have no outgoing edges, how many have one outgoing edge, how many have two outgoing edges, and so on?\n",
    "- How many edges of each indegree are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use Spark to answer these questions.   Do *not* load the entire graph into your Python driver program.   It is OK to use a separate set of Spark operations to answer each question."

    "Your main objective for this assignment is to perform *single-source personalized page rank* over the Gnutella graph.  To get started, you should make sure that you have a clear understanding of ordinary (i.e., non-personalized) page rank.  Read the description of page rank in Section 5.3 of [the course textbook](http://mapreduce.cc/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Personalized page rank is like ordinary page rank except:\n",
    "- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node.   Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n",
    "- Personalized page rank is initialized by assigning all probability mass to the source node, and none to the other nodes.   In contrast, ordinary page rank is initialized by giving all nodes the same probability mass.\n",
    "- Whenever personalized page rank makes a random jump, it jumps back to the source node.   In contrast, ordinary page rank may jump to any node.\n",
    "- In personalized page rank, all probability mass lost dangling nodes is put back into the source nodes.  In ordinary page rank, lost mass is distributed evenly over all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2  (10/24 marks):\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a Spark program to perform personalized page rank over the Gnutella graph for a specified number of iterations.   Your program should interactively prompt for two input values:\n",
    "- source node id (a positive integer)\n",
    "- iteration count (a positive integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should then perform personalized page rank, with respect to the specified source node, over the Gnutella graph, for the specified number of iterations.\n",
    "The output of your analysis should be the 10 nodes with the highest personalized page rank with respect to the given source.   For each of the 10 nodes, report the node's id and page rank value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure that your code is clearly commented.   In particular, for each significant Spark RDD that your code produces, your comments should describe the RDD.   That is, they should indicate how many elements you expect the RDD to have (in terms of graph parameters such as the number of nodes or edges) and what each element consists of.   For example, you might have a comment like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# this RDD has one element for each node in the graph\n",
    "# each element is a two-tuple:  (node-id, list of outgoing edges for node-id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are not able to get this working completely, try to make as much progress as possible.   Produce code that runs and clearly document what it does, so that you can receive some partial credit."

    "\n",
    "For the previous question, you implemented personalized page rank that ran for a specified number of iterations.  However, it is also common to write iterative algorithms that run until some specified termination condition is reached.\n",
    "For example, for page rank, suppose the $p_i(x)$ represents the probability mass assigned to node $x$ after the $i$th iteration of the algorithm.  ($p_0(x)$ is the initial probability mass of node $x$.)   We define the change of $x$'s probability mass on the $i$th iteration as $\\lvert p_i(x)-p_{i-1}(x) \\rvert$.   Then, we can iterate personalized page rank until the maximum (over all nodes) change is less then a specified threshold, i.e, until all nodes' page ranks have converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, modify your personalized page rank implementation from Question 2 so that it iterates until the \n",
    "maximum node change is less than $\\frac{0.5}{N}$, where $N$ represents the number of nodes in the graph.\n",
    "This version of your program should take only one input (the source node id).\n",

    "Spark provides the ability to *cache* RDDs.   This is useful when an RDD will be used more than once.   Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, go back to the code that you wrote to answer Question 3, and add caching.   (Caching will not affect the functionality of your code, i.e., what it computes.   It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
